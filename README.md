# Morse-Mobile-App-Challenge
This app, called Type-to-Tap, takes a user's text input and displays it as Morse code after they touch "Done" on the keyboard or after they touch "Submit" on the screen. If the user types a character that is not A-Z, a-z, or 0-9 then an instructional message is displayed instead of Morse code.
